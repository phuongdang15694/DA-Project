## RFM Model

The recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) model is used in marketing analysis to segment a company's customer base based on their purchasing patterns or habits. It assesses customers' recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend).

An RFM analysis determines which customers are of the highest and lowest value to a company based on purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value, in order to reasonably predict which customers are more likely to make future purchases.
